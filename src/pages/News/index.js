          <b>"Harry and the Hendersons"</b>
          (1987) is a sweet and charming family fantasy/comedy with a message of
          kindness and compassion for animals. While returning from a trip in
          the woods, George Henderson (John Lithgow) and his family hit a
          bigfoot with their car. Thinking the creature is dead, they take him
          home, but "Harry" (Kevin Peter Hall) soon awakens. Despite their
          initial fears, Harry is a kind and sensitive being, and the Hendersons
          become very fond of him. However, it is difficult to keep him a
          secret, and soon they begin to fear for Harry's safety.

          <b>Potluck attendees</b> are asked to bring a dish made without animal
          products that will serve 8 or more. If you’d like to bring food just
          for yourself or attend without eating, the fee is $5. We can usually
          accommodate a few guests who wish to attend without bringing a dish.
          The fee is $20, but pre-approval is required, and we’ll need to hear
          from you a day or more in advance.
