          Natural Diet of Humans - A Comparative Anatomy of Eating
        </h1>
        <h5>
          <b>
            The Comparative Anatomy of Eating, by Milton R. Mills, M.D., was
            originally published on 11/21/09 by VegSource.com.
          </b>
        </h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          Humans are most often described as "omnivores." This classification is
          based on the "observation" that humans generally eat a wide variety of
          plant and animal foods. However, culture, custom and training are
          confounding variables when looking at human dietary practices. Thus,
          "observation" is not the best technique to use when trying to identify
          the most "natural" diet for humans. While most humans are clearly
          "behavioral" omnivores, the question still remains as to whether
          humans are anatomically suited for a diet that includes animal as well
          as plant foods.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          And you might like to join the one or both of the discussion groups we
          host monthly in restaurants. There’s the Baltimore Vegetarian Meetup
          www.meetup.com/vegetarian-9/ and the Baltimore Vegan Meetup group.
          www.meetup.com/The-Baltimore-Vegan-Meetup-Group/ It's great to connect
          with friendly, like-minded people. Join us when you can!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A better and more objective technique is to look at human anatomy and
          physiology. Mammals are anatomically and physiologically adapted to
          procure and consume particular kinds of diets. (It is common practice
          when examining fossils of extinct mammals to examine anatomical
          features to deduce the animal's probable diet.) Therefore, we can look
          at mammalian carnivores, herbivores (plant-eaters) and omnivores to
          see which anatomical and physiological features are associated with
          each kind of diet. Then we can look at human anatomy and physiology to
          see in which group we belong.
