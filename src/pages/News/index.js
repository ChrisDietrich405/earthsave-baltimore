          We host vegan potluck meetings at Govans Presbyterian Church, 5828
          York Road in Baltimore, near Towson. Church is next to the historic
          Senator Theater. The potlucks usually meet on the fourth Saturday of
          each month, from 6:00 until 8:15. Attendees are encouraged to be
          up-to- date with Covid shots.

          <b>"Harry and the Hendersons"</b>
          (1987) is a sweet and charming family fantasy/comedy with a message of
          kindness and compassion for animals. While returning from a trip in
          the woods, George Henderson (John Lithgow) and his family hit a
          bigfoot with their car. Thinking the creature is dead, they take him
          home, but "Harry" (Kevin Peter Hall) soon awakens. Despite their
          initial fears, Harry is a kind and sensitive being, and the Hendersons
          become very fond of him. However, it is difficult to keep him a
          secret, and soon they begin to fear for Harry's safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Potluck attendees</b> are asked to bring a dish made without animal
          products that will serve 8 or more. If you’d like to bring food just
          for yourself or attend without eating, the fee is $5. We can usually
          accommodate a few guests who wish to attend without bringing a dish.
          The fee is $20, but pre-approval is required, and we’ll need to hear
          from you a day or more in advance.
        </p>

          There’s plenty of free parking. Drive around church to large parking
          lot, where you'll see the white Earthsave banner near the Fellowship
          Hall entry. You can get monthly event reminders by email by joining
          the Baltimore Vegan Meetup or Baltimore Vegetarian Meetup.
