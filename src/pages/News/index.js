            <p>Hope you can attend Earthsave’s final potluck event of the year, our annual “Thanks-Living Vegan Celebration”. We’ll enjoy some great vegan food and fellowship, and live music as well. You’ll have a chance to introduce yourself and share a success story or some thoughts on gratitude. That’s Saturday, November 30th, from 6:00 until 8:30. We’re looking forward to a special evening. Join us if you can.</p>
            <br />
            <p> Dinner Guests may choose to either bring a dish made without animal products (to serve 8) plus $5 (members pay just $2) donation; pay $15 (members pay just $12) to enjoy dinner and presentation; or pay $5 for presentation only. We eat first, then make announcements, and then hear the presentation. Let us know in advance, if possible, if you plan to pay for dinner rather than bring a dish. RSVP by calling 410-252-3043, or emailing Baltimore@Earthsave.org. Meetings are held at Govans Presbyterian Church, 5828 York Rd, Baltimore, 21212. Please RSVP and join us!
